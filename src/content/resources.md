# LangChain

We have a <a href="/CSCD01-Langchain-Sandbox.ipynb" download>lab for LangChain</a>, which should introduce you to the library in preparation for your open source contribution. It's not for marks, but try it for your own sakeâ€”you'll probably learn something!

You will need a Jupyter environment. If you don't have one set up, you can use [UofT's JupyterHub environment](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/hub/user-redirect/tree) in your browser. The lab is likely too long to finish in tutorial. If you end up with questions after your tutorial is over, ask a TA in office hours.
